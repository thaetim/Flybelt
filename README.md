# Flybelt mod
A wearable belt granting creative-like flight in exchange for hunger.

### Recipe
Craft the belt from gold ingots, gold nuggets, phantom membranes and an emerald feather (combining a feather with four emeralds). It will allow flying only after enchanting it on the Enchanting Table with Levitation (level II grants faster flight). The flight effect does not mitigate falling damage!
