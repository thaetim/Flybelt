# Flybelt

A small mod introducing a wearable belt granting creative-like (slower) flight in exchange for hunger. Designed primarily as a way for having a balanced option for flying in survival.

## Features:

### Crafting Flybelt:

The Flybelt is crafted using a Gold Ingot, some Gold Nuggets and Phantom Membranes, and an Emerald Feather.

### Enchanting with Levitation:

To enable flight, players must enchant the belt with the Levitation enchantment. The mod introduces two levels of Levitation enchantment:

- Levitation (Level I)
- Levitation (Level II)

Level II grants faster flight, however, it's crucial to note that the flight effect does not mitigate falling damage, so caution is advised during airborne adventures.

### Flight Restrictions:

While wearing the Flybelt, any other worn armor will considerably slow down the flight.

## Compatibility:

Currently supporting 1.20.1.
