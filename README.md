# Flybelt

A small mod introducing a wearable belt granting creative-like (slower) flight in exchange for hunger. Designed primarily as a way for having a balanced option for flying in survival.

### Features:

- Flight speed is slower than in creative mode.
- Being in air depletes the hunger.
- Player still takes falling damage as normal.
- Wearing other armor pieces proportionally slows the flight even more.
- Introducing Levitation as an armor enchantment, every time you put on an armor piece with this enchantment you will be given the standard Levitation effect unless it is the Flybelt.
- The belt has to be enchanted with Levitation to actually give the Flight effect.
- Higher Levitation levels increase the flying speed. Levitation III and no other armor results in creative mode speed.

### Crafting:

The Flybelt is crafted using a Gold Ingot, Gold Nuggets, Phantom Membranes and an Emerald Feather.
